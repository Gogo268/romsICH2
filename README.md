# What is this?
This is the romset for the https://github.com/tisenu100/86Box-ICH2 fork.

There's no huge differences between the regular romset and the mainline romset, besides the machines/ folder.

# How do i use this?
In the directory where you compiled 86Box-ICH2 (or where the binary resides), git clone this repository and rename the directory to 'roms' (without quotation marks).

If there's an romset update, in other to update the romset go into the roms/ directory and just run git pull.
